# Risk Prediction

Description: This project explores machine learning techniques for risk classification, focusing on the evaluation and optimization of different models.
Key Techniques: Implemented Perceptron, Decision Trees, KNN, and Neural Networks from scratch to analyze classification problems.
Performance Optimization: Fine-tuned models using cross-validation, hyperparameter tuning, and feature selection to improve predictive accuracy.
Evaluation Metrics: Used confusion matrices, accuracy scores, ROC curves, and F-scores to systematically compare models.
